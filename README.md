## Background story

I often need to show quickly some photos to my friends and wouldn't like to hassle with Dropbox or Google Photo sharing all the time. It's often just easier to move folder to a sshfs-mounted remote folder and that's it. 

But wait, nginx doesn't have any directory listing... what was that 2000s-era one-file-php gallery? oh, but it was really ugly. I have to create one of my own, with more options while still retaining the simplicity. And so quick 'n dirty gallery was born.

## Usage

1. Copy or clone index.php
2. Transfer index.php to a directory with images
3. That's it!
